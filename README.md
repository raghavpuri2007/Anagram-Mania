## About ##
Anagram Mania is my game for the 2022-2023 FBLA game and simulation programming event. Following the theme of a word game, I built an unscrambling word game. Users try to unscramble as many words - randomly fetched from a 12,000+ list of the most commonly used words in the English Dictionary - in 45 seconds. Users can choose to play four different levels: Easy Mode - 3 letter words, Medium Mode - 4 letter words, Hard Mode - 5 letter words, and Extreme Mode - 6 letter words. Anagram Mania has an In-Game shop, so users can buy power ups like “Time Freeze - Timer paused for 10 seconds,” “Free Letter - Letter automatically given,” and “Streak Boost - Increases the users streak by 6 words.” In addition, users can save their scores to the leaderboard, which shows the top 10 scores of all time.
